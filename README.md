ESP32 JWT Authentication with ESP-IDF

Overview
Welcome to the ESP32 JWT Authentication repository! This project demonstrates how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication on an ESP32 microcontroller using the ESP-IDF framework in Visual Studio Code. This setup is ideal for secure communication in IoT applications.

Features
Secure Authentication: Implements JWT for stateless authentication.
ESP-IDF Compatibility: Built using the ESP-IDF framework, suitable for advanced ESP32 projects.
Modular Design: Easy to integrate with existing ESP32 applications.
Robust: Efficient handling of JWTs for secure API communication.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

ESP32 Board: Any compatible ESP32 development board.
ESP-IDF: Install the latest version from the ESP-IDF official website.
Visual Studio Code: Install Visual Studio Code and the ESP-IDF extension.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/euginfrancis/ESP32_JWT_Auth.git
cd ESP32_JWT_Auth
Set Up ESP-IDF Environment

Follow the instructions in the ESP-IDF documentation to set up your development environment and ensure you can build projects.

Configure Wi-Fi Credentials

Edit the sdkconfig or the respective configuration file to set your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

Build and Flash the Project

Use the following commands in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
idf.py menuconfig    # Configure project settings
idf.py build          # Build the project
idf.py flash          # Flash the project to your ESP32
Example Usage
This project includes an example to demonstrate JWT authentication. Follow the instructions in the code comments to test the functionality and ensure your setup is working correctly.

How It Works
Authentication Flow: The ESP32 sends a request to an authentication server to obtain a JWT.
Token Storage: The JWT is securely stored in memory for subsequent use.
API Calls: For further API requests, the ESP32 includes the JWT in the HTTP headers to authenticate itself.

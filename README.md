![ESP32](https://img.shields.io/badge/ESP32-Project-orange) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Overview 🌐

Welcome to the **ESP32 JWT Authentication** repository! This project demonstrates how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication on an ESP32 microcontroller using the ESP-IDF framework in Visual Studio Code. Ideal for secure communication in IoT applications! 🔒

## Features ✨

- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for stateless authentication. 🛡️
- **ESP-IDF Compatibility**: Built with the ESP-IDF framework for advanced ESP32 projects. ⚙️
- **Modular Design**: Easy to integrate with existing applications. 🔄
- **Robust Handling**: Efficient JWT management for secure API communication. 📡

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **ESP32 Board**: Any compatible ESP32 development board. 🖥️
- **ESP-IDF**: Install the latest version from the [ESP-IDF official website](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html). 📚
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install VS Code along with the ESP-IDF extension. 💻

### Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository** 📥

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/euginfrancis/ESP32_JWT_Auth.git
   cd ESP32_JWT_Auth
2. **Set Up ESP-IDF Environment** 🌟

   Follow the instructions in the ESP-IDF documentation to set up your development environment.

3. **Configure Wi-Fi Credentials** 📶

   Edit the sdkconfig or the respective configuration file to set your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

4. **Build and Flash the Project** 🔄

   Use the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig    # Configure project settings
   idf.py build          # Build the project
   idf.py flash          # Flash the project to your ESP32
5. **Example Usage** 📖
   This project includes an example to demonstrate JWT authentication. Follow the instructions in the code comments to test the functionality.

## How It Works 🔍

- **Authentication Flow**: The ESP32 sends a request to an authentication server to obtain a JWT. 📨
- **Token Storage**: The JWT is securely stored in memory for subsequent use. 💾
- **API Calls**: The ESP32 includes the JWT in the HTTP headers for authenticating further requests. 📢
